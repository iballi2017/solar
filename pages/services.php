                    <p class="body">Our energy audit involves a comprehensive analysis of a prospective client load
                        to understand the nature of the solar Photovoltaic (PV) system and the right
                        battery capacity that will be suited for their needs. This involves a careful
                        consideration of the electrical power rating of the devices and the expected
                        duration of use on the inverter system. We deploy where necessary, our energy
                        logging tools to capture typical client energy requirement in real time. This
                        analysis, together with the configuration of system desired, informs the sizes of
                        different components that will be included in the design.</p>
